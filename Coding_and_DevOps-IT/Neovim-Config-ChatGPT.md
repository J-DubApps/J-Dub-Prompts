## Neovim config generation prompt

Please create a neovim configuration for me, using the following parameters: 

The config needs to be modern, with all of the tooling for things like lsp, syntax highlighting for all popular languages.

Some of my frequent tools include git integration and managing github pull requests, Telescope for fuzzy searching 

The config should support a modern color scheme (Capuchin or Tokyo Night are two themes I have used and like).

Plugins or tools that I don't want referenced / used in the config you generate, include: 

Packer (use lazy.nvim instead, as that is my preferred plugin manager)

At the end of the generated config you create, also separately provide step-by-step instructions on how to install the generated neovim config onto a Linux machine, MacOS machine, and Windows machine (I use Neovim on those 3 platforms).

Okay do your best!
