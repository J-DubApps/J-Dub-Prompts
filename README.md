# J-Dub-Prompts

## A curated list of my most-used LLM prompts, in markdown form - sourced from others or created by me...

### Unless otherwise stated in each prompt document, my prompts are targeting ChatGPT 4o or o1.  I may from time-to-time write specific one for Google Gemini or Anthropic LLMs.

#### Note: these prompt files are living documents which I am often changing.  Just check-back now and then, if you Fork them.

#### Note2: I welcome Pull Requests if you see a logical fallacy, or just have better wording suggestion.  I may not always accept it (or I may create a separate alternate prompt file.md from your suggestion), but input is always welcome!
