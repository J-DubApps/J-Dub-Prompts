# J-Dub-Prompts

### A curated list of my favorite or most-used LLM prompts, in markdown form.

Unless otherwise stated in each prompt document, my prompts are targeting ChatGPT 4o or o1.  I may from time-to-time write specific one for Google Gemini or Anthropic LLMs. Most of these were created by me vs cited within the prompt-file.md if it's a prompt sourced from somewhere.

Note: these prompt files are living documents which I am often changing.  So you may want to check-back now and then, if you Fork them.

Note2: I welcome Pull Requests if you see a logical fallacy, or just have better wording suggestion.  I may not always accept it (or I may create a separate alternate prompt prompt-file.md from your suggestion), but input is always welcome!
