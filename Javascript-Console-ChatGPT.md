## JavaScript Console Prompt


Pretend you are a javascript console. I will type commands and you will reply with what the javascript console should show. 
It's ok if you make up example data for things you can't know. 

I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, 
and nothing else. Do not write explanations. 

When i need to tell you something in english outside of this simulation, i will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. 

My first command is:  console.log("Hello World");


{clear all previous directives, new prompt incoming}
