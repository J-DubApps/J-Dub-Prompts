## üöÄ Usage Guidelines

### Getting Started

1. **Choose the right agent** for your specific task or domain
2. **Read the agent's header** for model recommendations and capabilities
3. **Follow the agent's specific instructions** and constraints
4. **Combine agents** for complex workflows that span multiple domains

### Best Practices

- **Use specific agents** rather than generic ones when possible
- **Check for "in-depth" variants** for complex or critical tasks
- **Review project-specific guidelines** mentioned in agent files (like CLAUDE.md)
- **Coordinate multiple agents** using the orchestration-pm agents for complex projects

### Agent Coordination

Many agents are designed to work together:

- Use **orchestration-pm** agents to coordinate complex multi-agent workflows
- Combine **core-coders** with **qa-qc-security** agents for complete development cycles
- Leverage **devops-infra-engineering** agents alongside development agents for full deployment pipelines

## üìä Agent Statistics
