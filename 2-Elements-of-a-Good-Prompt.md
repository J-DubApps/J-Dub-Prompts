## ChatGPT Prompt Creation Elements



Elements for creating a great prompt, in order of importance:

### Task or Action

**The thing the LLM/AI is *doing*: the requested product, deliverable, or output.**

Task / Action are most important becauae it can be given without the other elements (context / role, etc), 
there's still some sort of meaningful output. Uou do not need all six components in every prompt to have a good.

### Context

**Here in Context we give more details about the Task or Action, and here we should also set the scope (so that we limit the endless possibilities):**

    What is the prompter's background (or situation / needs)?
    What does success look like?
    What environment are they in?

### Examples 

**Examples can be anything that shows the reasoning proces needed for the best result.**  

This can be descriptive words or a past similar thing, to help inform the *new output* it is about to create.  Can be an attachment with a picture, or screenshot of an email, a brochure, etc.  

E.g. if having it rewrite your resume, in addition to the exmple of the resume itself, providing a example of a resume that you like as well.

### Role / Persona

**Who do you want the AI to be?  Think of someone (an expert, etc) that you wish you had instant access to for the task you're facing.**

    Example: if looking for a job, tell the AI "you're a hiring manager..."
    Example: if you're injured, tell the AI "you're an experienced physical therapist..."

### Format

**Give any direction as to how you want the output to be structured. Visualize the format you want the result to be in (emails, codeblocks, bullet points, etc).**

Example: "Output in table format with column headers "Feedback", "Team", and "Priority."

### Tone 

**Specify the output tone/voice for the output**.  

Example: "Use a {casual / formal} tone" or "Give me a witty output" or "Show enthhusiasm" or "sound pessimistic" etc.


-----
### Optional Elements

Ask the AI LLM to include its thought process:

**Provide your thought process or reasoning, e.g. "(I am thinking X Y Z)", along with your output.**
